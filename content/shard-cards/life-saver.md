The first time teamates die, an item appears on the ground, you can interact with the item to revive the teamate. A revival animation plays and then the teamate returns to life with 30% health. When the item is created, a countdown starts and if the player is not revived before the countdown ends then they can no longer be revived.
::

::text-paragraph
Enemies can interact with the items to "execute" the downed player to prevent them from being revived.
