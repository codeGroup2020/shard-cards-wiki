You can use the "Special Shard Card" keybind to transform into an archer. Doing so removes your primary and secondary weapons and gives you a bow with infinite arrows as a primary weapon. Instead of your normal lancer skills, you get three special archer abilities
::

::text-paragraph
While in archer form you can double jump at will.
::

::text-paragraph
Lancer skills you have already placed before transforming into an archer (such as traps), stay after transforming.
::

::text-paragraph
You can single click with the bow to fire an arrow instantly. You can fire arrows this way every 0.75 seconds. The bow fully charges in about 0.4 seconds, fully charging the bow does not give you much more range but it makes aiming and caluclating drop slightly easier.
::

::text-paragraph
The bow does not appear to have any damage dropoff at longer ranges. Headshots deal 150 damage, body shots deal 125 damage, and leg and arm shots deal 75 damage.
::

::text-paragraph
Your first archer ability is Detection Arrow. The next arrow you fire will send out a pulse wave with a range of 10 meters as soon as it lands, revealing enemies in the scan area. The arrows sends out a second pulse after 1 second.  This effect still triggers if the arrow directly hits an enemy.
::

::text-paragraph
The second archer ability is Explosive Arrow. For the next 10 seconds your arrows explode on contact with terrain, damaging enemies in a 1 meter range for 30 damage. While this effect is active, headshots appear to deal 200 damage, body shots still deal 125 damage, and arm and leg shots deal 125 damage.
::

::text-paragraph
The third archer ability is Vine Arrow. Immediately draw back and fire an arrow that creates a circular area of effect 10 meters in diameter around where the arrow landed with vines on the ground. These vines significantly slow enemies and deal 10 damage each second. This effect still triggers if the arrow directly hits an enemy.
