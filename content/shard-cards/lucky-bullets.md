<p>For every shot you fire, an extra bullet is fired in a random direction within a cone centered on the direction you are aiming. So the closer you are to the target, the higher the chance this extra bullet will hit the target.</p>
<p class="mt-4">The angle of spread appears to be 12°. Meaning at a distance of 5 meters the bullets will land within a circle with a diameter of 2 meters centered on the point you are firing at. At 10 meters it is a circle with a diameter of 4 meters, and at 20 meters the circle the bullets land in has a diameter of 8 meters.</p>
