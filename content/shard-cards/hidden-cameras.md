<p>You can press the "Special Shard Card" keybinding to enter a camera view from the POV of treasures on the map. You can toggle to the next or previous camera in this view to swap perspectives to a different treasure. You can turn and look around in all directions while in the camera views.</p>
<p class="mt-4">If a treasure is broken, "Your Drone Has Been Destroyed" will be displayed on your HUD, and you will no longer be able to look through that tresasures POV.</p>
