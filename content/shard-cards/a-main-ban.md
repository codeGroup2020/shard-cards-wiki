::text-paragraph
A Main is blocked with a desctructible barricade. See images below for the exact location of the barricade on each map.
::

::text-paragraph
The barricade is made up of multiple 2 meter wide sections, each of which has its own health pool. Each barrier section has 2,250 health. Each section has three "stages" of breaking, after you have dealt 750 damage to a section it will flash red momentarily, and the texture will become more cracked. After you have dealt another 750 damage (1,500 total), the section will flash red again and the texture will become even more cracked. And after you have dealt another 750 damage (2,250 total) the section will break.
::

::text-paragraph
Although in some places it looks like you could jump on top of or over the barricade, you cannot. There is an invisble barrier on top of the barricade that prevents you from standing on the barricade or jumping over it.
