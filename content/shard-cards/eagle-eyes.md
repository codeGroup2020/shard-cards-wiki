::text-paragraph
All enemies in line of sight are exposed. Even if the enemy is invisible they are still revealed.
::

::text-paragraph
Smokes block line of sight but mist from cards like Phantom Site A does not affect this card and enemies are still revealed even if they are far enough away in the mist that you can't see them.
::

::text-paragraph
Line of sight extends in a 180° arc in front of the player, so enemies can be revealed even if they are not on the your screen.
