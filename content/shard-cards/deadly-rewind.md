::text-paragraph
When you reload the last 10 bullets you fired (since you last reloaded) retrace their path. The bullets rewind along the path they were fired, not towards your current position.
::

::text-paragraph
Even though the visual trails extend past the point the bullets were fired from, they only deal damage along the exact path the bullet travelled when it was fired.
