The whole map is covered in green tall grass, this grass does not have any direct effect but it can conceal traps. A number of red stealth plants spawn at various points on the map. Players can crouch in the the plant to become invisible. They can still take damage while invisible and taking damage makes them become visible and they cannot become invisible in the plants again after taking damage.
