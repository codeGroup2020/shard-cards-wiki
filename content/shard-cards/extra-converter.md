::text-paragraph
N additional converters spawn for attackers. So if you put 2 points into the card you would have 3 converters in total.

::text-paragraph
You should never put more than 4 points into this card! Since there are only 5 attackers, and putting 4 points into the card gives you 5 total converters, one for each attacker.
